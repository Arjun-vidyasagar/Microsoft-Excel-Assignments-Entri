## Assignment 1: Fundamentals of Excels and Table Creation
This assignment contains a well-organized table with 20 rows of product data, including columns for Product Name, Brand Name, Price, and Category. The table is formatted using different table designs to enhance readability and presentation. It provides a structured way to manage and analyze product details efficiently.
## Assignment 2: Excel formulas and conditional functions
This assignment contains calculations and analysis performed on the previously created product dataset. It includes SUM, COUNT, and AVERAGE functions to determine total price, product count, and average price. MIN and MAX functions identify the lowest and highest product prices. SUMIF and COUNTIF formulas analyze category-based total prices and count products above a certain price. Text functions (LEFT, RIGHT, MID) extract specific parts of product details, while an IF statement categorizes products based on pricing thresholds. These calculations enhance data interpretation and provide meaningful insights into product trends.
## Assignment 3: Data Cleaning
This assignment focuses on cleaning the product dataset by identifying and removing duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy. Empty rows and insignificant columns are detected and eliminated to streamline the dataset. Missing values in the 'Price' column are addressed by proposing appropriate handling strategies, such as imputation or exclusion, to maintain data consistency and reliability. These steps enhance data quality, ensuring a clean and well-structured dataset for further analysis.
## Assignment 4: Data Wrangling
This assignment focuses on refining the dataset by ensuring proper data type conversion for the 'Price' and 'Quantity' columns, correcting any inconsistencies for accurate calculations. Additionally, the 'Product Name' and 'Brand Name' columns are reviewed for irregularities, standardizing text formatting to maintain data consistency and improve clarity for further analysis.
## Assignment 5: Filtering , sorting and lookup function
This assignment focuses on organizing and retrieving data efficiently using filtering, sorting, and lookup functions in Excel. Filtering is applied to display products based on price and category, while sorting is used to arrange data by price and category with a multilevel approach. The VLOOKUP function helps retrieve category details based on the product name, and HLOOKUP is used to find product prices. These techniques enhance data accessibility and improve analysis efficiency.
## Assignment 6: Pivot Tables and Trend analysis
This assignment includes essential data visualizations to analyze product sales and distribution. A pivot table summarizes total sales by category, with a filter for 'Electronics' and 'Clothing.' A bar chart visually represents sales across categories, while a pie chart illustrates brand distribution. Additionally, a scatter plot is created to examine the relationship between 'Price' and 'Quantity,' helping identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
# Module End assignment - Excel - Sales Analysis
This project analyzes sales data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on customer purchasing behavior. The dataset, stored in Bike Sales Data.xlsx, includes demographic and transaction details. The analysis involves data cleaning for accuracy, creating pivot tables and charts to uncover trends, and developing an interactive dashboard with at least five visualizations. This Excel-based approach provides a structured way to explore sales insights and customer patterns. Users can navigate through the dataset, visualizations, and dashboard to interpret key metrics and trends effectively.
